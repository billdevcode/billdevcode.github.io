                Hello I'm Bill and I am attending Dev Bootcamp's 19-weeks Full-Stack Web Developer program. During the 19-weeks, I will have an opportunity to collaborate with highly motivated and energetic people just like myself. It's going to be a life-changing experience and I'm looking forward to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This site is a work-in-progress and will serve as a showcase for my weekly blogs and projects. I will be adding more and more features each week as the program moves forward.
