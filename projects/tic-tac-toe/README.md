# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, X and O (in our case, we're using blue or red colors), who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Can you beat the computer?
