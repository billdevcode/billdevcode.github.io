#### What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned the padding area is wrapped in borders and they're both wrapped in the margin area 
and my content moves in the opposite direction of the property used for example `margin-top: 20px`
moves my content down. There's a good illustration of this box model here

#### What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned there are 4 CSS positioning: static, relative, fixed and absolute. They're all 
used differently to position elements within the page. 

#### What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
I found the easiest aspect was adding content, like `<p>`, `<li>`, headings, etc while the most difficult 
would have to be making the site responsive to different devices. I also had a challenge 
trying to position certain element exactly the way I wanted. 

#### What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned it's important to add a `class` to the elements so I could specifically target the element with CSS. 
There were a few times I had more than one `<img>` and I wanted them to have different sizes 
but I forgot to add a `class` so I had to go back fix them. There were also times I wanted to 
target all the `<p>` elements and being able to just use `p` in CSS to target all the `<p>` 
elements was a life-saver.
