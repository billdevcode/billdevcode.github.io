                        <h2>The Map Method</h2>
                            <p>
                                The map method is a highly useful Ruby method. 
                                Let's look at a real life example, you own a store and you have a list of products with their 
                                prices. One day you decided to double the price of all your products...because it's your store and 
                                you just felt like it. This is where we use the map method. 
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                So what does the map method do? Map goes through a provided object, does something to it 
                                then gives you the results. Some examples of what this looks like:
                            </p>
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li><code class="ruby-code">
                                    my_array = [2,4,6,8,100]
                                    <br>my_array.map { |num| num + 2 }
                                </code><ul>
                                <li>In this example, <strong>my_array</strong> is an array (aka an object) and it contains 
                                5 numbers: <code class="ruby-code">[2,4,6,8,100]</code></li>
                                <li>We use the map method on it by adding a period after <strong>my_array</strong> followed by <strong>map</strong></li>
                                <li>Then we add a bracket and a vertical bar, both of which are part of the map method's syntax</li>
                                <li>Next we see <strong>num</strong> which is just a name I made up as a variable to represent each of the 5 
                                numbers in <strong>my_array</strong> but you can use something else like <strong>x</strong></li>
                                <li>After that we see a closing veritical bar</li>
                                <li>Finally we see <strong>num + 2</strong> which means we are using each of the 5 numbers in 
                                <strong>my_array</strong> and adding 2 to them and of course we have the closing bracket</li>
                                <li>If we use the above codes, we'll see an output of <code class="ruby-code">[4, 6, 8, 10, 102]</code></li>
                            </ul></li></ul>
                            
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Let's take a look at another example:</li>
                                    <li><code class="ruby-code">
                                    my_inventory = {
                                        <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "pizza" => 2,
                                        <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "toy car" => 3,
                                        <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "book" => 20,
                                        <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "pencil" => 1,
                                        <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "TV" => 500,
                                    <br>&nbsp; }
                                    <br>&nbsp; my_inventory.map { |item, price| price * 2 }
                                </code></li><ul>
                                <li><strong>my_inventory</strong> is a hash (aka an object) and it contains 
                                5 items along with their prices</li>
                                <li>We use the map method the same way as the above example except we we use 
                                <strong>item</strong> instead of <strong>num</strong>, we add an extra variable called 
                                <strong>price</strong> and we added a comma between them to show these are two variables
                                <li>After that we see a closing veritical bar</li>
                                <li>Finally we see <strong>price * 2</strong> which means we are using each of the items in 
                                <strong>my_inventory</strong> and we are multiplying their price with 2</li>
                                <li>If we use the above codes, we'll see an output of <code class="ruby-code">[4, 6, 40, 2, 1000]</code></li>
                            </ul></li></ul>

                        <h2>To Map or Map!</h2>
                            <p>
                                There are 2 ways to use map, there's the map and there's map! (with exclamation). 
                                Map will output results with a new object while map! will change and 
                                output results using the existing object. The terms used to describe this is 
                                non-destructive (map) and destructive (map!). 
                            </p>
