                        <h2>What are If statements</h2>
                            <p>
                                If statements are widely used in Ruby and JavaScript as conditional statements for control flow. 
                                If we look at the above image, we see Homer Simpson have 2 actions. The 
                                first action is to say "mmm.. Keep it coming" and the second action is to say "I can't eat this!!!" 
                                Which action he takes depend on <code class="ruby-code">if food == 'junk food'</code>, this means if the
                                food is junk food then he will say "mmm.. Keep it coming" otherwise (else) he'll say "I can't eat this!!!"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the above example, only junk food will trigger Homer's first action, everything else will trigger his 
                                second action. Also there are only 2 conditions but we could easily have 5, 10 or more conditions 
                                by adding elsif or else if conditions which we will talk about below. 
                            </p>

                                Overall, the logic behind Ruby If and JavaScript If statements are the same but the syntax has some differences. 
                                Let's take a look at the code examples:
                            </p>
                            <pre class="ruby-code">
                                
                    Ruby                                                                JavaScript
                                        
        Example 1:  if true                                                 Example 1:  if (true)                                         
                        puts "this is true!"                                                { console.log("this is true!"); }
                    end                                                                 
                                        
                                        
        Example 2:  puts "this is true!" if true                            Example 2:  if (true) console.log("this is true!");


        Example 3:  if food == "junk food"                                  Example 3:  if (food === 'junk food') 
                        puts "mmm.. Keep it coming"                                         { console.log("mmm.. Keep it coming"); }
                    elsif food == "steak"                                               else if (food === "steak")                                    
                        puts "mm.. ssssssteak"                                              { console.log("mm.. ssssssteak"); }
                    else                                                                else
                        puts "I can't eat this!!!"                                          { console.log("I can't eat this!!!"); }
                    end   
                                        
                                    food == "junk food" ? "mmm.. Keep it coming" : "I can't eat this!!!"
                            </pre>
                            
                             <ul>
                                 Differences:
                                 <li>
                                    Ruby does not require parenthesis while JavaScript does: if true vs if (true) 
                                 </li>
                                 <li>
                                     Ruby allows a short one-line way of writing an if statement by putting the result before the if 
                                     (second example above) while JavaScript does not allow this syntax
                                 </li>
                                 <li>
                                     Ruby uses elsif while JavaScript uses else if
                                 </li>
                                 <li>
                                     Ruby requires the word "end" to close the if statement while JavaScript uses { } brackets but code 
                                     will pass without the brackets
                                 </li>
                             </ul>
                             
                             <p>
                                 The good news is both Ruby and JavaScript can use <code class="ruby-code">
                                     food == "junk food" ? "mmm.. Keep it coming" : "I can't eat this!!!"</code>. This is the 
                                     ternary operator which reads: condition ? result if true : result if false. The question 
                                     mark and colon are required as part of the syntax. Learn more about ternary operators
