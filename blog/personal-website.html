                                Building a personal website was fun and challenging at the same time. You could make a simple website 
                                or a fancy website depending on how much time and energy you want to put into it. What I enjoyed the most 
                                was making my site mobile responsive. It took a long time and it was challenging because I didn't know 
                                how to do it so I had to research, learn and implment what I've learned.

                                I think CSS positioning was the hardest challenge of making a website because we can design a beautiful 
                                site but if things aren't positioned right, it messes up the whole page, text gets cut off, images aren't centered, 
                                etc. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Besides learning about mobile responsive, I also learned about wireframing, using Chrome DevTools, linking up 
                                CSS to a HTML page and HTML5 semantics. It was a fun journey.
