                        <h2>What is a Class? What is an Instance?</h2>
                            <p>
                                In this blog post, we'll talk about Ruby classes and instances. Let's take a look at the above 
                                image. In Ruby, a class is a blueprint from which instances or objects are created. We can see a building 
                                is a class while the Empire State Building is an instance (object) created from building which makes sense 
                                because Empire State is a building right? The World Trade Center and Chrysler Building comes from the building 
                                class too because they are buildings as well.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let's take a look at the dog example. A dog is a class and it creates Lassie, a famous dog and an instance 
                                of the dog class. If you want to know more about Lassie then check out 
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassie" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.
                                If you happen to have a dog at home, well your dog came from the dog class too. 
                                If instead you have a cat then it came from the cat class and not dog class.

                    <pre class="ruby-code">
                                                class Puppy
                                                    def initialize(name)
                                                        @name = name 
                                                    end
    
                                                    def wag_tail
                                                        puts "#{@name} wags his tail!" 
                                                    end

                                                        puts "#{@name} looks at you with puppy dog eyes" 
                                                    end
                                                end

                                                ruby = Puppy.new("Ruby")
                                                ruby.wag_tail
                                                ruby.puppy_dog_eyes
                    </pre>
                    <section>
                        <h2>Ruby Class Example</h2>
                            <p>
                                The above is an example of how a class looks like in Ruby. We created a class called Puppy and it has 3 methods, 
                                basically behaviors or actions all instances of the Puppy class can use. Every class comes with an <strong> initialize </strong>
                                method which allows us to put default values into all new instances of the class. So when we 
                                make a new Puppy instance, we have to initialize with a name because that's how we defined 
                                the initialize method using <code class="ruby-code"> def initialize(name)</code>. Let's say we want to 
                                name our puppy "Ruby" so we would create a variable to save "Ruby" using <code class="ruby-code">ruby = 
                                Puppy.new("Ruby")</code>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then we save the Puppy's name into an instance variable called <code class="ruby-code">@name</code>. We know 
                                this is an instance variable because it has the @ character. Instance variables are variables that can be used 
                                and reused throughout all methods of the class. Next we have the wag_tail method that outputs an action using 
                                the name we intialized with. We can then call this method using the variable we created using 
                                <code class="ruby-code">ruby.wag_tail</code> and we can call the last method using 
                                <code class="ruby-code">ruby.puppy_dog_eyes</code>. Try these codes out on 
                                <a href="https://repl.it/languages/ruby" target="_blank">repl.it</a> and create more class methods for your 
                                Puppy. 
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Classes and instances are great for organizing and reusing our codes. The methods we created in the Puppy class 
                                won't be accessible by the Kitten class or vice versa. And by making our Puppy class, we can make many puppy
                                instances and all of them can use the methods we created in the Puppy class. Learn more about Ruby class
