                        <h2>What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that uses repetition of tests  
                                and short development cycles. First, we write an automated test case (initially failing) that 
                                defines an improvement or new feature, then we produce the minimum codes to pass that test, 
                                and finally refactor the codes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Based on the book <strong> Test Driven Development: By Example </strong> by <i> Kent Beck </i>,
                                we can break TDD down into 6 steps: 
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Add a test: </strong> each new feature begins with writing a test. The developer can write a test 
                                by understanding the specifications and requirements through use cases and user stories. It makes the developer 
                                focus on the requirements before writing codes. This is a very important differentiating feature of TDD.</li>
                                <li><strong>Run all tests and see if the new test fails: </strong> this validates the test is working correctly, 
                                and the required feature does not already exist. The new test should also fail for the expected reasons. This 
                                step increases the developer's confidence that the unit is testing correct constraint and passes only in 
                                intended cases.</li>
                                <li><strong>Write some code: </strong> this step is to write some code that causes the test to pass. The only 
                                purpose is to pass the test even if the code written is not perfect or inelegant.</li>
                                <li><strong>Run tests: </strong> if all test cases pass then it means the new code meets the test requirements. 
                                If the test do not pass then adjust the code until it passes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Refactor the code: </strong> clean up the code, remove duplicates, improve readability and 
                                maintainability. This will be increasingly valuable later in the software lifecycle.</li>
                                <li><strong>Repeat: </strong> start a new test and make sure the steps are small with as few as 1 to 10 
                                edits between each run. If new code does not quickly satisfy a new test or other tests fail then it's suggested 
                                to undo or revert rather than excessive debugging. This is where version control places a big role.</li>
                            </ol>

                        <h2>TDD Benefits and Limitations</h2>
                      <p>Benefits:</p>
                           <ul>
                               <li>By focusing on the test cases first, the developer must imagine how the functionality or feature 
                               is used by the end-users rather than preconceptions</li>
                               <li>This drives the design of the program as the developer have to be concerned with the interface before the 
                               implementation</li>
                               <li>TDD offers the ability to take small steps when necessary</li>
                               <li>TDD ensures all written code has been tested at least once</li>
                               <li>While TDD increases the total amount of code, it helps to limit the number of defects or bugs</li>
                               <li>Catching and preventing bugs early in the process avoid lengthy debugging later in the project</li>
                               <li>TDD can lead to more flexible codes because each cycle is written and tested independently and integrated 
                               together later</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>Limitations:</p>
                           <ul>
                               <li>TDD does not perform sufficient testing where full functional tests are required to determine success or 
                               failure such as user interface, programs that work with databases or programs that depend on specific network 
                               configurations</li>
                               <li>Management support is essential, otherwise management may feel time spent writing tests is wasted</li>
                               <li>Unit tests are typically written by the developer who is also writing the code being tested. If the developer 
                               misinterprets the requirements then the code and unit tests are both incorrect therefore, the tests will pass 
                               and give a false sense of corectness</li>
                               <li>Writing and maintaining an excessive number of tests takes up time</li>
                           </ul>
